## Free Exercise DB

Over 800+ exercises and imagery, Completely open Public Domain and in JSON format

### Why?

I started building another fitness related app and was looking for free/open source exercise lists and imagery I stumbled upon
[exercises.json](https://github.com/wrkout/exercises.json) which was amazing though the data wasn't structured the way I wanted it and I also wanted a free browsable/searchable frontend to the data inspired by [this issue](https://github.com/wrkout/exercises.json/issues/5) so I restructed the data and built a simple frontend to it :)


### Running the site


[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
npm run test:unit
```

### Run End-to-End Tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

```sh
npm run test:e2e:dev
```

This runs the end-to-end tests against the Vite development server.
It is much faster than the production build.

But it's still recommended to test the production build with `test:e2e` before deploying (e.g. in CI environments):

```sh
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```
